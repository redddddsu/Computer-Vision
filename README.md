## About

This is me documenting my journey in self-studying computer vision. At UC Riverside, the computer vision course is unfortunately an electrical engineer elective so it won't contribute to my degree but I became very interested in the topic when learning about OpenCV and paddleOCR on the internet. I have recently purchased a computer vision book by Richard Szeliski and began my journey on CV. Although I can use OpenCV or other API, it would be best to learn from the lowest level first.

### Image processing (currently)
Learned about image manipulation by point operations. 

Since using point operations uses a pbm image file and uncompressing an image is a difficult process, I plan on using stb_image.

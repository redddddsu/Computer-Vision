## About

This is me documenting my journey in self-studying computer vision. At UC Riverside, the computer vision course is unfortunately an electrical engineer elective so it won't contribute to my degree. Still, I became very interested in the topic when learning about OpenCV and paddleOCR on the internet. I have recently purchased a computer vision book by Richard Szeliski and began my journey on CV. Although I can use OpenCV or other API, it would be best to learn from the lowest level first.

### Image processing (currently)
Learned about image manipulation by point operations. 

Used ppm image files first since tracing through all the pixels is easier.

Used stb_image since uncompressing a png/jpg/... is difficult.

Used cumulative distribution function and histogram equalization to spread intensity throughout the image.
